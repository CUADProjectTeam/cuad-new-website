It is equipped with a full Ardupilot autonomy stack, retractable grabber, Raspberry Pi, camera, and Coral TPU making it capable of onboard computer vision and navigation. Configured for full autonomy, Buttery is designed to complete our self-designed challenge where we must navigate obstacles and retrieve a small cube before returning home.",

With a carbon-fiber-infused 3D printed frame, this quad is our most crash-resistant and perfect for teaching new members how to fly. It also demonstrates that a tough and smooth flying frame can be 3D printed, with the right design. It is built with freestyle quad components and equipped with an FPV camera for easy high-speed control.",

Greasy struggled to get consistent stable flight but taught us a ton about designing frames for large drones, finding good components, wiring, and debugging.",
